        Hi! I'm James Ferrett, a web developer / copywriter / graphic designer
        dedicated to bringing your digital visions to life. Proficient in
        JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS, I wield these languages to craft
        seamless, user-centric websites. My journey didn't start or end with
        coding. For the past nine years, I've immersed myself in the worlds of
        copywriting and graphic design, honing a way with words and an eye for
        aesthetics. This fusion of skills means I don't just create functional
        websites; I engineer content-rich and visually captivating digital
        campaigns that resonate with end-users. What truly sets me apart is my
        problem-solving. I love deciphering unique customer challenges and
        tailoring solutions that fulfil needs clients weren't even aware of. I
        love when the art of design meets the logic of programming. Together,
        let's transform ideas into creative digital campaigns. Thank you for
        visiting, and I look forward to collaborating with you.
